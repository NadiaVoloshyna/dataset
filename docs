# Requirements
- Open your chosen dataset in Python. Output the total number of rows of data.
- Implement appropriate programming constructs to count the total number of rows of data in the chosen dataset.

- Improve and verify
  Can you repeat the analysis using the Python libraries introduced (Numpy, Pandas) 
  and verify data processing and transformations where appropriate? 

- Count the number of records in your chosen dataset to verify it has loaded correctly.
- Correctly perform a non-trivial operation (transformation [log, scaling], reduction [min, max, mean] etc.) on the data.
- Structure your code using functions where appropriate. 
- Identify any patterns or trends in the records values.
- Verification of your scripted result using Python software libraries e.g. NumPy and Pandas.
- Include error handling, user input, loops and iteration. 

# Request 
Write a program that constructs the portrait of the typical bad hero and typical good hero. The program takes heroes data set as inputs and
displays the results in a form of tables with average or mostly met traits for each type of hero.
...compare, statistics..
Make more complicated - ask user for the criteria how to split the data set
User inputs their parameters and gets who are they in heroes world

# Analysis
The inputs to the program are the following:
- the initial data set with bad and good heroes characteristics (floating-point numbers, strings)

The program splits the data set in order to separate characteristics of bad heroes and good heroes, 
calculates a mean for numeric columns, the mostly met for non-numeric columns, and displays the results in a tabular format. 

The proposed user interface is:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
| An average bad guy portrait:    An average good guy portrait:   |
|  Gender:                           Gender:                      |
|  Eye color:                        Eye color:                   |
|  Race:                             Race:                        |
|  Hair color:                       Hair color:                  |
|  Height:                           Height:                      |
|  Publisher:                        Publisher:                   |
|  Skin color:                       Skin color:                  |
|  Weight:                           Weight:                      |

# Pseudocode
The program has three main parts:
1. Import the data set and split it.
2. Calculate a mean for numeric columns and mostly used for non-numeric columns for each of two dataFrames.
3. Display the results in tabular format.

Import “SuperHeroes.csv” data and make a copy of it
Perform the basic checks on the data, log errors
Split the data set based on the 'Alignment' column

Display the header of the table..................

Calculate frequency for non-numeric values and a mean for numeric values 
Display the results in a tabular format using format string
