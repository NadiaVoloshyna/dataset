# Requirements
- Open your chosen dataset in Python. Output the total number of rows of data.
- Count the number of records in your chosen dataset to verify it has loaded correctly.
- Correctly perform a non-trivial operation (transformation [log, scaling], reduction [min, max, mean] etc.) on the data.
- Structure your code using functions where appropriate. 
- Identify any patterns or trends in the records values.
- Verification of your scripted result using Python software libraries e.g. NumPy and Pandas.
- Include error handling, user input, loops and iteration. 

...compare, statistics..
User inputs their parameters and gets who are they in heroes world
change to `string for prints (f)

# Request 
Write a program that finds the requested hero in the dataset and displays their characteristics compared with the average.

# Analysis
The inputs to the program are the following:
- the initial data set with bad and good heroes characteristics (floating-point numbers, strings)
- the name of the hero (string)

The program excepts the hero's name as user's input, checks if the requested hero exists, 
splits the dataset in order to separate attributes of bad heroes and good heroes, 
calculates a mean for numeric columns and the mostly met for non-numeric columns 
to construct the average bad/good profile, generates the hero's profile and compares it 
to the average bad/good hero's profile. 
The program displays the requested hero's characteristics compared with the average in a tabular format.

The proposed user interface is:
-------------------------------------------------------
|                "hero's name":  Average "good/bad":  |
|  Gender:             X                 X            |
|  Eye colour:         X                 X            |
|  Race:               X                 X            |
|  Hair colour:        X                 X            |
|  Height:             X                 X            |
|  Publisher:          X                 X            |
|  Skin colour:        X                 X            |
|  Weight:             X                 X            |

# Pseudocode
The program has four main parts:
1. Input the user's hero name and a dataset.
2. Generate the hero's data.
3. Compute the average good/bad profile characteristics.
4. Display the comparison of the hero's profile with an average in a tabular format.

Input the hero's name
Import “SuperHeroes.csv” data and make a copy of it
Check if the hero is in the dataset, log an error
Generate the hero's characteristics
Find the hero's alignment
Split the data set based on the 'Alignment' column
Perform the basic checks on the data, log errors
Calculate frequency for non-numeric values and a mean for numeric values 
Compare the hero's characteristics with average
Display the results in a tabular format using format string
