# Requirements
- Open your chosen dataset in Python. Output the total number of rows of data.
- Count the number of records in your chosen dataset to verify it has loaded correctly.
- Correctly perform a non-trivial operation (transformation [log, scaling], reduction [min, max, mean] etc.) on the data.
- Structure your code using functions where appropriate. 
- Identify any patterns or trends in the records values.
- Verification of your scripted result using Python software libraries e.g. NumPy and Pandas.
- Include error handling, user input, loops and iteration. 

# Request 
Write the program that takes the hero's name as user's input and displays the hero vs average characteristics comparison table, the converted hero, and health weight statistics.

# Analysis
The inputs to the program are the following:
- the initial data set with heroes characteristics (floating-point numbers, strings)
- the name of the hero (string)

The program excepts the hero's name as user's input, checks if the requested hero exists, splits the dataset in order to separate attributes of bad heroes and good heroes, 
calculates a mean for numeric columns and the mostly met for non-numeric columns to construct the average bad/good profile, generates the hero's profile and compares it 
to the average bad/good hero's profile. The program displays the requested hero's characteristics compared with the average in a tabular format.
The program finds the hero's counterpart in the opposite alignment dataframe and displays the result.
The program makes two dataframes with male and female height/weight features, transfers them into NumPy arrays, calculates the number of male and female heroes with 
a healthy/unhealthy weight using the ideal weight formula, and prints the results.

The proposed user interface is:

Enter the name: 'hero's name'
                  'hero's name'    Average 'good/bad' 
------------------------------------------------------
  Gender:               X                 X            
  Eye colour:           X                 X            
  Race:                 X                 X            
  Hair colour:          X                 X            
  Height:               X                 X            
  Publisher:            X                 X            
  Skin colour:          X                 X            
  Weight:               X                 X              
------------------------------------------------------
The converted hero for 'hero's name' is:
          Name Gender Alignment  Height  Weight
     XXXXXXXXX   XXXX      XXXX    XXXX    XXXX
....................................
Some statistics about the heroes:
Healthy male heroes: XX
Unhealthy male heroes: XXX
Healthy female heroes: XX
Unhealthy female heroes: XX
....................................

# Pseudocode
The program has four main parts:
1. Input the user's hero name and a dataset.
2. Generate the hero's data.
3. Compute the average good/bad profile characteristics.
4. Display the comparison of the hero's profile with an average in a tabular format.

Input the hero's name
Import “SuperHeroes.csv” data and make a copy of it
Check if the hero is in the dataset, log an error
Generate the hero's characteristics
Find the hero's alignment
Split the data set based on the 'Alignment' column
Perform the basic checks on the data, log errors
Calculate frequency for non-numeric values and a mean for numeric values 
Compare the hero's characteristics with average
Display the results in a tabular format using format string
